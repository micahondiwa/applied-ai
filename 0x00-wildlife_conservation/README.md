# Wildlife Conservation in Cote d'Ivoire

**About the projecct**

- The project uses images taken by camera traps used by conservation researchers who take these images of animals in the wild. Some of these images are blank, some of them conatin images of an animal. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a computer vision application, a solution, a machine learning model that would take an image and be able to identify whether on it and which animal it is.
