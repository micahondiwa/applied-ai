# Wildlife Conservation in Cote d'Ivoire

**About the project:**

- The project uses images taken by camera traps used by conservation researchers who take these images of animals in the wild. Some of these images are blank, some of them contain images of an animal. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a computer vision application, a solution, a machine learning model that would take an image and be able to identify whether there is an animal on it and which animal it is.
